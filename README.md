# ProveRealNFT
My (Kiran Fernando) Final Year Project for University (Queen Mary University of London BSc Computer Science)

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This solution is designed to be a very small part of the anti-counterfeiting/provenence stack a company would need to implement , in order to protect themselves. We create a secure portal for luxury items manufacturers to produce digital proofs of authenticity and ownership for each item they produce. 

This platform has been designed such that firms can use a shared database on-chain, without worries a rogue firm may choose to impersonate another. It would need to be used in conjunction with ERC-721 (blockchain held collector item) viewing dApps such as OpenSea or a specially designed wallet.

Please open the folder ProveRealnftFinalZIP to experiment with the source code - unchanged from the time of submission in April 2019. 

*CODE HAS NOT BEEN SECURITY AUDITED BY A PROFESSIONAL FIRM, although the smart contract has very good code coverage and has past all testing. USE WITH CAUTION*
